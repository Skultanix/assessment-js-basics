// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = `The second step, wherein software developers examine what in the program will need to exist to solve the problem(s) they wish to have the software solve.`
const design = 'The third step, in which the members of the software development team examine how the software will look and how users will interact with it. Additionally, this will include a general idea for how the software will be written.'
const implementation = 'The fourth step, wherein the software development team puts the proverbial pieces of the puzzle together in the intial builds of a software.'
const testingAndIntegration = 'The fifth step, wherein the initial builds of the software are tested for bugs and potential errors before the software becomes fully implemented.'
const maintain = 'The final step, in which the implemented software/program has been implemented and is routinely updated and screened for potential errors encountered by users.'
